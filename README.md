# P00: Project 1
*Our initial device idea is: a light, audio, and motion sensor to control light brightness.*
*LightBrightsupreme for short*

## Purpose
*plugs into an outlet and lets the lights/lamp plug into it. it has a sensor that senses how much light is in it's
area of the room and adjusts the light acordingly. the goal is to have three or four of these lamps in a room and have
them talk to each other so that they turn off together. the product will have differnt
modes as well, one for even brightness and another for motion sensor dimming. the motion sensor dimming mode would 
increase the light while you are near differnet lamps. the motion sensor dimming mode would save electricity while the perfect brightness mode can be asthetic*

*The LDRs that we will be using are probably not as acurate as we initialy thought, because of this the light will probably not be able to transition its brightness levels fluidly. A solution to this is having three light levels that it can transition through (low light, med light, high light).*
